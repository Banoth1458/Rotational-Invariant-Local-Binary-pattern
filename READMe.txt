           FACE RECOGNITION Using Rotational Invariant Local Binary Pattern

%This Project is developed by 16IS06F and 16IS09F,M.Tech CS-IS,NITK.

%Given face database fetched from Essex University,which is not a big dataset,113 different male persons with 20 each person different frames,20 female persons with 20 each person with different frames

%divided the dataset into training set and testing set

%training phase starts by "Training program" followed by "classifyModel" program

%Training phase will generate training dataset for the Model

%Testing phase start with recognize program

%We used machine learning algorithm "K-nn classifier" to train and classify the model.Use classifyModel for ModelClassification
